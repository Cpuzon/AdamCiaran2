For this project Adam and I have worked very well together to get our project done. 
The only problem we had was our time management wasn't that good. 
We did most of our work at home so we didn't really do much at school. 
We put a lot of effort into this project and we had really good comunication even though our git and our repositry wasn't working in the first week.
I learnt a lot of knew things especially java script as i knew nothing before this project but i now understand it.
