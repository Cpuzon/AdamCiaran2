For this project Adam and I have worked very well together to get our project done. 
The only problem we had was our time management wasn't that good. 
We did most of our work at home so we didn't really do much at school. 
We put a lot of effort into this project and we had really good comunication even though our git and our repositry wasn't working in the first week.
I learnt a lot of knew things especially java script as i knew nothing before this project but i now understand it.
The store page had the most trouble as we didn't know what we needed for the java script.
We then had to watch youtube tutorials to figure out how to make it work and we eventually got it done.
The homepage was hard at first to get the header and nav working but it soon became easier as we moved onto the slide show. 
I learnt how to do the slide show in java script and html. 
I did have a problem with figuring out how to make a feature product but we realised we didnt have enough time to finalise it so we got rid of it.
Originally we had a different colour scheme as shown in our planning but we changed it to make it stand out more.
overall the project went well and i think i got 4 out of 5 as i didn't manage my time properly.
