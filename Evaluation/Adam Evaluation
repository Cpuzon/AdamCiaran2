I believe that overall the project went well.
At the start organising who would design and the design of the header that would be in every site was a little difficult.
Overall throughout the project I believe that Ciaran ended up getting more of the website completed as I tried to complete a website from scratch.
I tryed to make all of the html and css for the store page by myself but we ended up using a template as it looked better than what I had done.
