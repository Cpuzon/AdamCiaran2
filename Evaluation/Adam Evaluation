I believe that overall the project went well.
Ciaran and I worked very well together and decided on waht our website would be about very quickly.
Giving us lots of time to complete the project.
At the start organising who would design and the design of the header that would be in every site was a little difficult.
We had quite a few problems throuhgout the project though I think that the video tutorials that we watched where very useful for the project.
Despite these probelms I believe that the end product is of  high quality and standard the colour scheme is quite good and all of the pages follow the same style.
Overall throughout the project I believe that Ciaran ended up getting more of the website completed as I tried to complete a website from scratch.
I tryed to make all of the html and css for the store page by myself but we ended up using a template as it looked better than what I had done.
Originally we were going to make a game but we had to ake our own code which was too difficult so we ended up just making a website.
We had to use quite a lot of guides and things on the internet for the javascript portion of the webpage and I don't understand how most of it works.
Though the html and css I can make sense of how it works and what each section does in the webpage.
At the start of the project I had some difficulty trying to do the git and github comands until I went through all of the guides.
